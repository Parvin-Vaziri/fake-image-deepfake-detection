# Fake Image Deepfake Detection

This project focuses on detecting fake images using deep learning.
Several CNN-based models were trained and compared to classify images
as real or fake.

## What I did
- Preprocessed image data
- Trained multiple CNN models
- Compared model performance

## Models
- SimpleCNN
- ResNet18
- EfficientNetV2-S

## Dataset
The dataset is not included in this repository.

## Tools
- Python
- PyTorch
- NumPy
